	Projects:</h3>

	<li>
		<strong>The challenge of curation:</strong> OLPC-SF has a blog post (<a href="http://olpcsf.org/node/61" target="_blank">http://olpcsf.org/node/61</a>): <a href="http://archive.org" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> (IA) has 3M+ books. Lets say if you wanted a subset, IA did not have the mechanism for extracting a subset...they assume full access to the library. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lou_Jepsen" target="_blank">Mary Lou Jepsen</a> presented at Books in Browsers 2011, and highlighted the problem of curation. Since then, IA has created a script that fetches books and metadata from a bookmarks file. You can feed the bookmark file into the script which will bundle the books for you. Then you can run a second script that will create a CSV file for Pathagar, which allows for bulk import into <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sverma/pathagar-a-book-server" target="_blank">Pathagar</a>. More work neded to streamline the process. Ideally, all this should be done via Pathagar&#39;s web interface.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Bookserver Virtual Machine</strong>: We now have a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sverma/pathagar-a-book-server" target="_blank">Pathagar</a> Book Server Virtual Machine. Details at <a href="http://olpcsf.org/node/60" target="_blank">http://olpcsf.org/node/60</a> Run your own book server with a small pre-loaded library!</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Schoolserver on ARM</strong>: Work continues. Looks like we are close. George Hunt has a OLPC School Server blog at <a href="http://schoolserver.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://schoolserver.wordpress.com</a>. <a href="http://www.laptop.org.au/" target="_blank">OLPC Australia</a> very interested in running the server on an XO. Their model looks at one server per classroom.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>OLPC SF Community Summit 2012:</strong> Planning for the summit has begun. Main event will be Oct 19 (Fri) registration and social reception, Oct 20 (Sat) sessions, Oct 21 (Sun) sessions. We plan on having workshop sessions covering <em>Education, Technology and Outreach</em>. We will also have room for panels, stories, speed geek, and BoFs. There is some demand for pre and post sessions, so we&#39;ll plan on reserving space for that.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s all folks! For now, at least.</p>
