<p><a href="http://one.laptop.org/about/people/matt-keller" target="_blank">Matt Keller</a> is traveling through Ethiopia, visiting a settlement in Wonchi. This is the same place where <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506466/given-tablets-but-no-teachers-ethiopian-children-teach-themselves/" target="_blank">OLPC dropped off</a> (no helicopter involved...yet) a stack of tablets with <a href="http://cananian.livejournal.com/67703.html" target="_blank">software</a> that is designed to help children learn. We&#39;ve seen some amazing results of the children being able to write a few letters in English. Here are a couple more videos, posted with Matt&#39;s permission.</p>
