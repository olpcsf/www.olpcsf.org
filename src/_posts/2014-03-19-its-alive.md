<p>Given the recent excitement of dead/alive discussions about OLPC and olpc, I&#39;ve put together a short set of questions to help assess where the &quot;organization&quot; is. By organization, I don&#39;t mean a company or an institution, but the organization in general. The questions are about mission, vision, strengths, and so on.<br />
	<br />
	Here&#39;s the survey.<br />

	Don&#39;t peek into the results spreadsheet until you&#39;ve taken a shot at the questions yourself. This will keep your responses objective. Above all, be sincere and descriptive in your responses.<br />

<p>Let&#39;s see what picture emerges.</p>
