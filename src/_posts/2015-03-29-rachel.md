<p>At the May 15th, 2014 meeting of olpcSF.org (I believe this was the meeting hosted by Bruce Baikie at Inveneo, 972 Mission St., San Franciso,) Bruce introduced us to the Rachel Pi project: a content server developed by <a href="http://worldpossible.org/">WorldPossible.org</a>. &nbsp;It provides a Server/Service combination using the Rasberry Pi along with system software and content compiled by the WorldPossible team. (The <a href="https://youtu.be/yhAehSQoMl8">&quot;Three-Minute World Possible Intro&quot;</a>, accessible from their home page, is well worth viewing.)</p>
<p>A system was soon up and running but unfortunately the video material comes in a format (mp4) that can not be rendered by the XO OLPC laptop. The most straight forward solution seemed to be to convert the mp4 files to ogv and make the corresponding edits in the html files. &nbsp;Scripts were developed to do this and we had a version usable by the XOs within a short time.</p>
<p>At the February 2015 meeting, a consensus was reached that webm would be a better choice and so now the scripts were re-written to support conversion of mp4 files to either format (ogv or webm.) These Python scripts are <a href="https://github.com/alexKleider/Convert">available on github</a>:</p>
<p><code>$ git clone git@github.com:alexKleider/Convert.git</code></p>
<p>In the mean time the Banana Pi has become available and WorldPossible has released a version of Rachel for it. &nbsp;The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Pi">Banana Pi</a> is based on a dual core ARM processor and should therefore support more clients than the single core ARM of the Raspberry Pi B model. &nbsp;A version 2 of the Raspberry Pi with a quad core ARM processor has also appeared on the market. &nbsp;Both of these platforms are under study and it is hoped that we can have a version of Rachel running on all three.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.aiscs.org/projects.php">project planned for Tanzania</a>, spear headed by Camille Harris with help from Hilary Naylor, and that&#39;s where our modified Rachel running on one (or more) of the Pi platforms will go; The <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nyamongo,+Tanzania/@-1.4659998,34.514172,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x182cd4cf57ded9ad:0x630aaf58935ffa0f">primary school is in Nyamagongo</a>.</p>
