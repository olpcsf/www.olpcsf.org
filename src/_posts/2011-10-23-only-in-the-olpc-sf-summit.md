<p>Only in the OLPC-SF Summit will you get in one room:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A governor of 11 Municipalities in the Philippines (Governor Sato)</li>
	<li>
		A pillar of San Francisco and American politics (Carol Ruth Silver)</li>
	<li>
		Education proponents from Jamaica, Rwanda, Thailand, Vietnam, Haiti and around the globe</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is discussing solutions on how to reach more kids and make their lives better.&nbsp;There are no keynote speakers in this summit. Everyone&#39;s voice is important and everyone chimes in the discussion. Prepare to jump from your seat and offer a solution at the OLPC-SF Summit.</p>
