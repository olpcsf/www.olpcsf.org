<p>The group came together at <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu">SFSU&#39;s Downtown Campus</a> on another beautiful October day. There were discussions in the various tracks about Etoys Kedama, Solar Installations and Start up Rsources. In the afternoon everyone came together to discuss OLPC Perceptions and the future of small deployments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of issues were agreed upon that were important to ensure that the deployments were successful. One needs to make sure that their&nbsp;volunteeers are happy, their teachers are happy, that there are communications between all and most importantly that laptops are available for the children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great resource for those involved in the OLPC is the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC:Support_gang">OLPC Support Gang</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a worldwide volunteer group that helps teachers and children who are users of the XO laptops. They contribute through&nbsp;email, forum, chat room and at times phone to answer your questions.</p>

	How can people contribute to deployments success? &nbsp;They can become members of Sugar Labs and receive their communications. The <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/2011-2012-candidates">Sugar Labs annual election</a> will be taking place in November. Anyone can become a member of Sugar Labs and be eligable to vote for the board. The hope is that Sugar be less &quot;geeky&quot; and more &quot;mature.&quot; You can vote at <a href="mailto:members@sugarlabs.org">members@sugarlabs.org</a>. When you do, mention how you are involved in OLPC to gain you access.&nbsp;</div>

	Another great way everyone can contribute is through the updated Help Manual. It can be accessed at <a href="http://j.mp/xomanual">http://j.mp/xomanual</a>. By updating the manual one is contributing to the XO used in the laptops and it will also be integrated into the computers HELP section.&nbsp;</div>

	The best way of course is to volunteer and get involved in one of the many projects around the world!&nbsp;</div>
