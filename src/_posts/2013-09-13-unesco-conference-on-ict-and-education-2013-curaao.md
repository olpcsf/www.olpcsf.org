<p>I&#39;ll be presenting and running a couple of workshops at the <a href="http://www.ict-and-education.com/index.php?topic=home&amp;style_id=0" target="_blank">UNESCO Conference on ICT &amp; Education 2013</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao" target="_blank">Cura&ccedil;ao</a>. The first workshop will focus on the overall report and update of OLPC and Sugar worldwide (that&#39;s a wide footprint!). The second will focus on the server/micro-cloud backend for content management, system monitoring and learning analytics. I&#39;ll be sharing a fair bit of our experiences from Jamaica, where we have been looking at <a href="http://184.106.206.200/commons/blog/peering-journal-data" target="_blank">usage statistics based on Journal data</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also looking forward to meeting with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/acesuares" target="_blank">Ace Suares</a>, who has been spearheading the effort in Cura&ccedil;ao, Bonaire and St. Maarten for many years, both by supporting the pilots which seem to have gained <a href="http://www.coldwellbankercur.com/index.php?action=addon_blog_article&amp;id=479" target="_blank">a fair level of success</a>, and by the translation of <a href="http://translate.sugarlabs.org/pap/" target="_blank">Sugar into Papiamento</a>.</p>
