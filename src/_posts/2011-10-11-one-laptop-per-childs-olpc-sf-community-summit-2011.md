<p><a href="file:///C:/Users/Julie B/Desktop/OLPC (1).png"><img alt="" src="file:///C:/Users/Julie%20B/Desktop/OLPC%20(1).png" /></a>Imagine a day without access to your computer? The One Laptop per Child San Francisco Bay Area community (<a href="http://www.olpcsf.org">olpcsf.org</a>) sees to it that no child goes without a computer in under-developed countries and even shows them how to use and fix them.&nbsp; This is a community of volunteer educators, technologists, anthropologists, enthusiasts, champions and others. Monthly meetings are held at the SFSU downtown campus where they share stories, exchange ideas, solve problems, foster community and build collaborations around the One Laptop per Child project.</p>
<p>Sameer Verma, Ph.D. Professor of the Information System at San Francisco State University is the force behind the grassroots group that has organized the <a href="http://www.olpcsf.org"><strong>OLPC SF Community Summit 2011</strong></a>. The Summit is a combination of panel discussions, &ldquo;Birds of a Feather&rdquo; sessions, speed-geeking and much more. A few of the topics that will be covered include Education, Technology and Outreach &amp; Deployments of OLPC programs. Last year it was a local meeting, this year the Summit is open to an audience worldwide.</p>
<p>Dr. Verma, who is passionate about the cause due to growing up in India where many children still lack educational opportunities.&nbsp; says, &quot;The Summit will bring together people who want to help make education for the world&rsquo;s children a priority, not a privilege. They share the belief that the One Laptop per Child is one of the most revolutionary endeavors going on in the world today.&rdquo;</p>
