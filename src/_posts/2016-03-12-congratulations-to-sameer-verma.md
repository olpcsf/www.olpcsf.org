<p>&nbsp;Our own Sameer Verma has been elected for a two-year term on the <a href="https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board" target="_blank">Sugar Labs Oversight Board</a>! He joins the board of 7 members governing the future of Sugar Labs.</p>
<p>Elections for the Sugar Labs Oversight Board were held in January. All seven seats were up for election, the top 4 winners were elected for two-year terms and the following 3 were elected for one-year terms. In this way approximately half the board is up for election each year, going forward.</p>
<p>Board meetings are held on the first Friday of every month over IRC. You can find the <a href="https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Oversight_Board/Minutes">meeting minutes</a>&nbsp;on the Sugar Labs wiki.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Sameer and the other board members. OLPC-SF is excited and is looking forward to what 2016 brings for Sugar Labs and the OLPC Community.</p>
