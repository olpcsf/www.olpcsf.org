 <p>At the May 15th, 2014 meeting of olpcSF.org (I believe this was the meeting hosted by Bruce Baikie at Inveneo, 972 Mission St., San Franciso,) Bruce introduced us to the Rachel Pi project: a content server developed by <a href="http://worldpossible.org/">WorldPossible.org</a>. &nbsp;It provides a Server/Service combination using the Rasberry Pi along with system software and content compiled by the WorldPossible team. (The <a href="https://youtu.be/yhAehSQoMl8">&quot;Three-Minute World Possible Intro&quot;</a>, accessible from their home page, is well worth viewing.)</p>
