<p>Back in May 2010, Sayamindu Dasgupta <a href="http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/server-devel/2010-May/004899.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that he was working along with Kushal Das&nbsp;on a book server - Pathagar:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="rteindent1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
Hello,
Kushal and I have been working on a bookserver, which we believe,
would help deployments to distribute ebooks easily via the school
server/or any centralized infrastructure (with the help of Get Books
activity running at the Sugar end).</pre>
<p>The prospect of a book server was exciting because while I work with Moodle every day (http://ilearn.sfsu.edu), Moodle is excessive for a reference style library of objects. For books and such, we need a way to organize the collection, make it indexable and searchable and have a plan to grow. OPDS, the spec behind Pathagar allows for such a federated expansion of the catalog across multiple sites. James Simmons has a nice writeup in his ebook <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/e-book-enlightenment/the-pathagar-book-server/" target="_blank">E-Book Enlightenment</a>. That was very helpful to get started.</p>

<p>After a brief stint with installing Pathagar on Debian and Ubuntu servers on multiple platforms -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olpcsf.org/projects/pathagar-sheevaplug-edition" target="_blank">SheevaPlug</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sameerverma/status/185931523499884547" target="_blank">DreamPlug</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ljndawson/status/261929695300423680" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>&nbsp;(dubbed Bookberry Pi), and at a x64-bit server at Rackspace - Alex Kleider and I have been testing different variations to the installation and configuration process. We even have a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olpcsf.org/pathagar" target="_blank">virtual machine</a>&nbsp;to test out Pathagar complete with a small pre-populated library. Along the way, we came up with the need to populate Pathagar with a large number of books. The presumption was that if we were to curate a large number of books from say, <a href="http://archive.org" target="_blank">The Internet Archive</a>, using their bookmark feature, we would like for a way to bulk-upload the books to Pathagar - metadata and all - and then be able to deploy it disconnected from the Internet and perhaps even disconnected from the electrical grid!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been working with <a href="https://github.com/rajbot" target="_blank">Raj Kumar</a>&nbsp;at the Internet Archive for some time now. His <a href="https://github.com/rajbot/fetch_ia_item" target="_blank">script</a> pulls items from the Internet Archive along with metadata, and then we bulk-upload the collection to Pathagar. Along the way, there were a few minor glitches with the tagging system. A chance meeting with <a href="http://sethish.com/" target="_blank">Seth Woodworth</a> at the <a href="http://p.irateship.com/" target="_blank">p.irateship</a> and a conversation about Python projects brought Seth into the project. He&#39;s modified the tagging system using <a href="https://github.com/alex/django-taggit" target="_blank">django-taggit</a>, which is able to handle spaces in tags used on different items. Next, we&#39;ve been testing Pathagar to run on Fedora 18, so that it can run on a OLPC XO 1.75 running the <a href="http://schoolserver.org" target="_blank">XSCE school server</a>. The plan is that Pathagar will run alongside the core XSCE server, serving books to the deployment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Sayamindu&#39;s blessing and Seth&#39;s help, we&#39;ve also consolidated all the work into a new &quot;organization&quot; on GitHub. You can find it all at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/PathagarBooks" target="_blank">https://github.com/PathagarBooks</a></p>
<p>Next steps are to package the django-app for distribution across different platforms. RPM? DEB? easy_install? pip? No clear answers, but we are still in conversation. Oh, and for conversations, we have an email list, thanks to our friends at The Internet Archive!&nbsp;Please do subscribe and join in the discussion: <a href="http://mail.archive.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pathagar" target="_blank">http://mail.archive.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pathagar</a></p>
<p>Pathagar can be used to serve any kind of media. PDF, EPub. Even Ogg, or MP4. Perhaps it could serve as an offline repository of Sugar activities? Indexable, Searchable, Offlineable.&nbsp;Oh, the possibilities!</p>
