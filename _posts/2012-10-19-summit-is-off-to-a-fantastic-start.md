<p>We got off to a fantastic start. San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee has declared October 20, 2012 <strong>One Laptop Per Child Day in San Francisco!</strong></p>
<p>The proclamation reads:</p>
<p><strong><em>&quot;THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED</em></strong> that I, Edwin M. Lee, Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco, on occasion of the fourth annual OLPC Community Summit, do hereby proclaim October 20, 2012 as...</p>

<p>This is a wonderful achievement for the OLPC project and for the community that plugs away tirelessly to make wonderful things happen for children all over the world. Our own local community that makes this event happen is no less commendable. Alex and June Kleider for the reception on Friday and the closing party on Sunday, and for taking care of so many volunteers, Aaron Borden and Robert Howard for organizing the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; meetings, taking care of the summit website and other related details, Grant Bowman for tackling the social media, Hilary Naylor for organizing the sessions and Speed Geek , Nina Stawski for the wonderful t-shirt design for this year, Bill Tuk for those strange lenses (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/node/54" target="_blank">they are called cabochons, in case you were wondering</a>) in your registration packets and Mike Lee for the stickers, and a bunch of other volunteers for their enthusiasm, ideas and support. This summit wouldn&#39;t happen year after year without the support of local community volunteers. This project wouldn&#39;t bloom without the support of the global community volunteers.</p>
<p>There was another document presented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Wiener" target="_blank">San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener</a>, on behalf of the the Board of Supervisors of the City and county of San Francisco. This was a total surprise for me. I am honored and humbled to receive this Certificate of Honor and I would once again say, that this commendation is for the community as well - plugging away to empower children and their communities around the world. Much appreciation and respect to Carol Ruth Silver, who is the driving force behind our continued recognition through the Mayor&#39;s proclamation and the Certificate of Honor by the City and County of San Francisco.</p>
