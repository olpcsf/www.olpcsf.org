<p>Back in 2012, we gave all attendees of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/CommunitySummit2012/" target="_blank">OLPC SF Community Summit 2012</a> a bag of lenses, some sticky tape and other ways to place a tiny lens on top of the XO&#39;s fixed-focus camera and convert the Telescope activity into a microscope like magnifier. The lens itself came from a decorative acrylic cabochon priced at about 2 cents a piece! You can read more about the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/node/117" target="_blank">Tuk Lens Kit here</a>.</p>
<p>Bill, the creator of the Tuk Lens kit, saw one of my posts on using a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/node/124" target="_blank">Lego focus jig</a> to adjust the focus of the object, and decided to build one himself. His constraint was to use parts readily available around him. This focus jig that he has, is built using a plastic clip sawed off from a plastic square tube, a smaller plastic square tube to hold the sliding mechanism, a popsicle stick (washed off, he tells me!) sandpaper, hanger wire, bottle cap, some glue, outer rubber coating from eletrical wire for friction, and a nut-bolt-washer trio to hold things in place. And of course, the famous <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/node/54" target="_blank">Tuk cabochon lens</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting focus jig is amazing! You can see the details of the construction the the picture below (click on the photo for a larger version). The &quot;Eye of George&quot; shows the eye of George Washington on a US dollar bill, both in its original scale and magnified.</p>
<p>It&#39;s amazing what kind of creativity spurs forth when the constraints are difficult. What kind of a jig would you build, with parts in your neighborhood?</p>
