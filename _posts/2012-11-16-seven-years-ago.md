<p>Today is XO Day! Credit and kudos to <a href="http://www.nurturingeducation.com/management/tkkang.html" target="_blank">T.K. Kang</a> of Hong Kong to come up with the idea a few years ago and keeping up with it.</p>

<p>On November 16, back in 2005, the One Laptop per Child concept was released by Kofi Annan, Nicholas Negroponte and Mary Lou Jepsen at a press conference at the WSIS in Tunisia.</p>

<p>Seven years!</p>
<p>A lot has changed, from the original idea, it&#39;s roadmap and where the OLPC XO laptop is poised to go in the near future. What amazes me is that the concept is still alive, thanks to an unstoppable community. Celebrate!</p>
