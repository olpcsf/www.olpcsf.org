<p>We are now accepting poster submissions! Some people have written and said that they would be unable to attend the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/summit">community summit</a> in San Francisco. If you can&#39;t make it to San Francisco, this is a good way for the others to know about your effort.</p>
<p>See the full invitation and instructions at: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/CommunitySummit2012/posters">{{ site.baseurl }}/CommunitySummit2012/posters</a></p>
