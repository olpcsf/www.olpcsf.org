<p>From Wikipedia a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabochon" target="_blank">cabochon</a> is:</p>
<p class="rteindent1"><em>A <b>cabochon</b>, from the Middle French caboche (head), is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone" title="Gemstone">gemstone</a> which has been shaped and polished as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facet" title="Facet">faceted</a>. The resulting form is usually a convex top with a flat bottom. Cutting en cabochon is usually applied to opaque gems, while faceting is usually applied to transparent stones. Hardness is also taken into account as softer gemstones with a hardness lower than 7 on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness" title="Mohs scale of mineral hardness">Mohs hardness scale</a> are easily scratched, mainly by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide" title="Silicon dioxide">silicon dioxide</a> in dust and grit. This would quickly make translucent gems unattractive&mdash;instead they are polished as cabochons, making the scratches less evident.</em></p>
<p>A big &#39;<em>Thank you!</em>&quot; to Bill Tuk for that tip. I&#39;ve looked at and used cabochons for a while now but I didn&#39;t know what these were called. But Bill deserves a bigger &quot;<em>Thank you!</em>&quot; for bringing a bag full of plastic (acrylic?) cabochons to a meeting a while ago. Place the hemispherical cabochon on the XO camera and hold it in place with tape and you have a nice convex magnifier! Of course, Bill tells me (and Mike Lee) that a drop of water works well too. Saliva isn&#39;t very clear, so stick with water <img alt="smiley" height="20" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/sites/all/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.gif" title="smiley" width="20" /></p>
<p>Here are some photos from Bill. I am thrilled his tips have made it to the <a href="http://olpclearningclub.org/activities/a-water-drop-microscope-for-the-xo-laptop/" target="_blank">OLPC Learning Club</a> and <a href="http://edu.laptop.org.au/sites/default/files/education_newsletter_ed_12_april_2012.pdf" target="_blank">OLPC Australia</a>!</p>
