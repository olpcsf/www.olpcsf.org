<p>A picture is indeed worth a thousand words...and more.</p>
<p>We put together this coffee table book with 38 pictures from around the world. Only two copies were printed. These were raffled off and were won by <a href="http://one.laptop.org/about/people/samuel-klein" target="_blank">Samuel J Klein</a> and <a href="http://ehe.osu.edu/edtl/faculty/BucciTerri.htm" target="_blank">Terri Bucci</a>. I saw SJ&#39;s copy in the Cambridge office. I hope Terri is enjoying hers.</p>

<p>Then, I promptly forgot all about it :-) As we started discussing this year&#39;s summit plans, I remembered the book! While the copies that were raffled off were special, you can get your own copy <a href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/invited/2050752/c78ce6242f0e1b87aadc14bded48c14fb1700459" target="_blank">here</a>. The book contains Creative Commons licensed pictures from OLPC&#39;s Flickr stream. It is processed by Blurb, including printing, shipping etc.</p>
