<p>Coffee. I&#39;m a fan! I have a coffee table at home as well, although my kids use it to stage their Lego handiwork, so it&#39;s hardly used as a coffee table. Whether you have a coffee table or not, here are three versions of a coffee table book that we produced for various community summits. These books were given away as raffle prizes, but these are also for anyone to purchase. The pricing is at cost, as determined by <a href="http://www.blurb.com" target="_blank">Blurb</a>, the press that produces the paper copies. Pick a softcover version, or a hardcover with a dust jacket. We are happy to share these with you - with gratitude to an incredible project, the fantastical world of children around the world and the wonderful community that makes it all happen. Get one for yourself, or give one as a &quot;Thank you&quot; gift to those who have helped on this journey. Enjoy!</p>
