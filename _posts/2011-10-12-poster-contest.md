<p>Many small deployments go unheard and unnoticed, but <em>every</em> single laptop out there counts. Each laptop is a potential beacon of learning. To that end, Bruce Baikie of <a href="http://www.green-wifi.org/" target="_blank">Green WiFi</a> is running a poster contest at the upcoming <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/summit" target="_blank">OLPC San Francisco Community Summit 2011</a>. Take a look at the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/CommunitySummit2011/poster" target="_blank">page</a>, and submit a poster about your project or deployment. Use the provided templates or make your own.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll print a bunch and display these at the event. More importantly, we&#39;ll post all the PDFs up on our site. So, even if you don&#39;t plan on being at the event, send in a poster!</p>
