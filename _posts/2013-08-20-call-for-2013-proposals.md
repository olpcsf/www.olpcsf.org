Please keep in mind that we are looking for interactive and engaging workshop-style sessions rather than slide presentations. The goal of the sessions is to present information&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;to work on problems. Think of other people who may be interested in working with you. We are an open community and love to hear from all sides of the problem. Now is your chance to work face to face and hash out the challenges we face. Don&#39;t be afraid to talk to others in the community and include them in your proposals. Think constructive, not just instructive!</p>
