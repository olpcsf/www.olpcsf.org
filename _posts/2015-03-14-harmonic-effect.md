	<p>One of my old-time hobbies has been the open reel tape recorder. I&#39;m a big fan!</p>
	<p>Magnetic tape adds a certain &quot;warmth&quot; to the music. It seems this effect comes from the harmonic effect generated as the tape slides past the tape head. People like this effect so much, that modern-day digital music editors come with &quot;tape effect plugins&quot; for popular tape and decks.</p>

	<p>So, I ran an experiment. I took the OLPC XO laptop and used Pippy Activity to generate a sine wave (6 beeps) and recorded it on tape. I should see one peak at 1000Hz.</p>

<p>Then, I played it back from tape, and looked at the signal on Measure Activity. We see a major peak at 1000Hz, but smaller peaks at 3000Hz and 5000Hz.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/sites/default/files/u8/11015109_10152852329633752_7112878338124079754_n.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 473px;" /></p>
<p>Very exciting! Definitely some harmonic effect going on here. Will have to investigate more to see what else happens on tape, and how it differs across brands and machines.</p>
