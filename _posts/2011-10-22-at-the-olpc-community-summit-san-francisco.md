<p>The actual conference started on a gorgeous October Saturday. Three tracks were held consisting of Education, Technology and Outreach. Some of the sessions were about<em> Lesson Plans, Recent Developments in OLPC/Sugar, How to Volunteer in Haiti Community School, Start Up Resources</em> and so much more. Along the walls hung colorful posters as part of a contest to share visually the various projects attendees are involved in. Videographers were also busy interviewing &nbsp;folks about their involvement in OLPC&#39;s mission to provide laptops globally to children regardless of their economic situation. It was a true gathering of like minded folks with a mission to change the world for the better one laptop at a time.&nbsp;</p>
