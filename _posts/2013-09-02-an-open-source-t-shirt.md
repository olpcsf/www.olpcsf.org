<p>If you&#39;ve ever attended the <a href="http://www.olpcsf.org/summit">OLPC-SF Community Summit</a>, you&#39;re familiar with the t-shirts that we give to all attendees. In the past, we&#39;ve had a volunteer step up to create the design which has worked out well but we&#39;ve always wanted to encourage openness and collaboration where possible. After all, this is a <em>Community&nbsp;</em>Summit.&nbsp;Which is why this year, we are hosting a T-shirt Design Collaboration to get more involvement from the community in the open-source spirit. We&#39;re hoping to get some creative designs from various members of the community. We&#39;re encouraging people to collaborate on their designs as well. This is an experiment of sorts and we&#39;re looking forward to what ideas come out of it, whether it&#39;s new designs or new ways to collaborate on a t-shirt. If you&#39;re interested, or know someone who is, visit the <a href="http://www.olpcsf.org/CommunitySummit2013/tshirts">t-shirt collaboration guidelines</a> page for more information. See you at the summit!</p>
