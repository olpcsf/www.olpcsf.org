	A chance meeting with a graduate student from Berkeley, California in an airport in Madagascar and 2 discarded OLPC laptops began the Maroantsetra, Madagascar Deployment. In September 2009 we brought 10 donated OLPC-XO laptops to Maroantsetra, Madagascar, an ecologically fragile area where hardwood forests are being destroyed along with habitat and threatened and endangered species. Our pilot program was established in the town library during the summer break and during the school session, nearby schools.</p>
<p>
	We sent five more laptops in December and, after one year, we are currently providing instruction in six schools and the library, training classroom teachers as well as volunteer older students who assist with the teaching.</p>
<p>
	We have already reached hundreds of students with our pilot project. Although there is no Internet connection possible in the schools, there are plans to set up a school server with content including electronic books, a Malagasy dictionary (in progress), downloads from the Internet, and many other e-learning tools and activities. The following video link shows the program in action.</p>
