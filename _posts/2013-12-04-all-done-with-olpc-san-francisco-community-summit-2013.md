<p>We are all wrapped up with the summit! All attendees have returned. Some have even gone on to attend the OLPC BaseCamp event in Malaysia. All the photos are uploaded. So are the videos of interviews and the hangout session at the closing party. Find all the media at <a href="http://www.olpcsf.org/CommunitySummit2013/media" target="_blank">http://www.olpcsf.org/CommunitySummit2013/media</a></p>

<p>In all, it was yet another successful event. Successful because the community came and made it their own. Worked on projects. Made new plans. Built new relationships. Will we do it another time? We are not quite <em>that</em> recovered as yet :-)</p>
