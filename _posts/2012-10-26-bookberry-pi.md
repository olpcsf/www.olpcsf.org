<p>This is the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sverma/pathagar-a-book-server" target="_blank">Pathagar Book Server</a> running on a Raspberry Pi. The distribution is derived from Raspbian, which itself is from derived from Debian. I removed all the GUI bits and added some server bits to make Pathagar happen. I&#39;m calling the image Bookberry.</p>
<p>Debian -&gt; Raspbian -&gt; Bookberry.&nbsp;</p>
