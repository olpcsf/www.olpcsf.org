	On Friday evening, we will be screening <a href="http://webthefilm.com/">WEB</a>&nbsp;at 5pm. The documentary follows Peruvian families living in remote villages in the Amazon Jungle and Andes Mountains as their children experience the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) program, gaining access to the Internet for the first time. WEB considers both the benefits and complications that arise from digital connections. Alongside the poignant and sometimes humorous local stories, the film includes interviews with leading thinkers on the Internet including Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley, Wikipedia&rsquo;s Jimmy Wales and OLPC founder Nicholas Negroponte for an insightful look at our times.</div>
