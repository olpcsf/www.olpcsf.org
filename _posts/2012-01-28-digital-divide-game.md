	THE DIGITAL DIVIDE GAME: DEVELOPING 21ST CENTURY SKILLS USING TECHNOLOGY<br />
	<br />
	This workshop will highlight and showcase &ldquo;The Digital Divide Game.&rdquo; Instructors and Administrators will learn how the game sets the stage for 21st century skills and also allows students to exercise those skills while playing this life skills game. In the game, students are forced to make alliances, assess risk, trade and share resources, make tough decisions and assume leadership roles in a hands-on simulation of cultures impacted by the digital divide: a global issue that focuses on the divide between those who have access to technology and those that don&rsquo;t.<br />
	<br />
	Sameer Verma from One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC SF) and Tina Lee, Director of Learning and Innovation, from Zero Divide San Francisco will be presenting, and will help us see this global issue through an educational lens. While observing the game in action in a classroom with middle school students, attendees will also have an opportunity for hands-on time with the game. Lunch will be provided. For more information contact Jennifer Gaspar-Santos at (650) 342-5436 or jgs@stmatthewsday.org.</p>
