<p>We are getting ready to set up the annual community summit (2014 will be the sixth such summit) and we&#39;ve made a significant change to the way we organize it. This year, we will be running an online and an in-person event. The summit will be held October 17 to 19, 2014. You can either be here with us in-person, or be online and attend! Let us know what your thinking is at this time, so we can organize accordingly.</p>
