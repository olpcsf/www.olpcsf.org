<p>
	Bhagmalpur is a classic village for such a project, and while there are thousands of such villages in India that could use these resources, I am looking at Bhagmalpur for a personal reason: my family lives there.</p>
<p>
	I am a professor of Information Systems in the College of Business at San Francisco State University. My research topics are related to diffusion and adoption of innovative technologies. My current focus is on the diffusion and adoption of Free and Open Source Software.</p>
<p>
	The school mentioned above was started by my family many years ago, but was transferred to the government later on. We have lived in this village for many generations. Our ancestry can be traced back to the days of Mughal Emperor Akbar (mid-to-late 1500s), so our family has a vested interest in the education and general upliftment of the quality of life in Bhagmalpur. Knowing and understanding the local community is important in terms of assessing the needs and providing apt solutions.</p>
<p>
	In a sense, I have witnessed both the supply side and the demand side of this project, the demand being in places like Bhagmalpur, and the supply being the terrific worldwide FOSS community and the OLPC project. Putting the two together is of professional and personal interest to me.</p>
