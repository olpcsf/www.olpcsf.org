<p>This Thanksgiving break was a fun and relaxing one, but as usual, Mira (my 7-year old daughter) had her &quot;<em>I&#39;m bored!</em>&quot; spells one day. After trying to get her to draw, color, paint, read, etc. I tried something new. We went outside and looked at interesting things. The Moon was pretty that evening. Then came the question:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Does the Moon move in the sky?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>A telescope, a laptop with the <a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4481" target="_blank">Telescope activity</a>, and oodles of patience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First we spotted the Moon. It takes a bit of fiddling to get the moon to show on the screen. The XO&#39;s hinge doesn&#39;t stay put, so you may have to keep fiddling until you get the Moon nicely centered on your screen. The <a href="http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4481" target="_blank">Telescope activity</a> allowed us to lower the exposure so we could get a clearer picture of the Moon, complete with its craters. Adjusting the Gain helps too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, we got a few shots of the Moon. You can check the previews after the shots are done and transfer these to the Journal one at a time.</p>

<p>Then, I got bored, and had some extra time, so I made this movie :-) A trip to the Moon with Mr. Sinatra. By the way, did you know, astronaut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Aldrin" target="_blank">Buzz Aldrin</a> played Sinatra&#39;s version of&nbsp; &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon" target="_blank">Fly me to the Moon</a>&quot; when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon#Association_with_space_travel" target="_blank">he landed Apollo 11</a> on the Moon? Neat!</p>
