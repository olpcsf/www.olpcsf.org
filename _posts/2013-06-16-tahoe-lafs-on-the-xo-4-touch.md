<p>File this under the &quot;<em>because I can</em>&quot; section. A while ago, when looking for replacements to Dropbox, I came across <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org" target="_blank">Tahoe-LAFS</a>. A least authority file system, where your data is uploaded to a set of servers, where they all have pieces, encrypted <em>before</em> the upload by <em>you</em>, and a bare minimum is needed to recover the original. More details at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoe-LAFS" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoe-LAFS</a></p>

<p>As with all cool stuff I come across in the Free and Open Source domain, I wanted to run this thing! I would need many computers. That&#39;s where the XO came in. I was interested in running Tahoe-LAFS on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO-1" target="_blank">OLPC XO-1</a> for two reasons. I had access to over a dozen XO-1 laptops and these could all mesh using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11s#Child.2Fstudent_laptops" target="_blank">draft version of IEEE 802.11s</a>. I started off enthusiastically <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/pipermail/tahoe-dev/2012-January/006922.html" target="_blank">over a year ago</a>, but ran into problems with space, compiling, etc. and eventually gave up. I restarted <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/pipermail/tahoe-dev/2012-June/007499.html" target="_blank">a little while later with XO-1.5 machines</a>, given that these have more processing power and RAM, but that didn&#39;t get very far either. Also, the 1.5 didn&#39;t support the mesh. The &quot;<em>powers-that-be</em>&quot; had replaced it with ad-hoc, which frankly sucks compared to the mesh, but that&#39;s another blog.</p>
<p>I am on the <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tahoe-dev" target="_blank">Tahoe-LAFS list</a> and keep up with the chatter. When I got my hands on a <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO-4_Touch" target="_blank">OLPC XO-4 Touch</a> (and my summer vacation started) the bug came back! I pulled out the XO-4 Touch and ran through another installation. First, I tried <em>yum install tahoe-lafs</em> (and variations of tahoe-lafs) but to no avail. Yeah, Fedora - a project, but never a product. There&#39;s another blog :-( but I digress. By the way, I had no trouble with <em>apt-get install tahoe-lafs</em> on my Ubuntu laptops and Debian servers, so I got a chance to actually test it all out with <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/wiki/TestGrid" target="_blank">the Tahoe-LAFS testgrid</a> and it all worked.</p>
<p>On the XO-4, <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/browser/trunk/docs/quickstart.rst" target="_blank">I downloaded the source</a>, installed <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/pipermail/tahoe-dev/2012-January/006966.html" target="_blank">a set of dependencies</a> to help with the compiling, and ran with the build. Then, I ran out of space on the device. So, after editing /etc/fstab and bumping /tmp to 150MB, I rebooted and re-ran the build, and this time it worked! I tested it out with the testgrid and it behaved as expected. Wow! Finally, Tahoe-LAFS on a XO, that too a ARM powered one (but one that does not do mesh :-\ ).</p>

<p>Anyway, next, I proceeded to look into this &quot;<a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/pipermail/tahoe-dev/2013-June/008382.html" target="_blank">Grid in a Box</a>&quot; script that sets up an introducer (the node that introduces you to the grid) and a storage node. I set this up on my home desktop. Now I had my own mini storage grid. I used the introducer.furl to point my other machines to it, including the XO-4. It all worked! I am able to push files from the XO-4 to the grid and pull these up elsewhere on other machines.</p>

<p>It was a <em>muahahaha</em> moment! I&#39;ve got more computers. All kinds. Old ones. New ones. Ones that look like a plug. Ones that look like a box. Servers too! I&#39;m on a roll to expand my storage empire and watch it all rock and roll!</p>
