<p>I met <a href="http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~levine/" target="_blank">Prof. Barry Levine</a> at an event hosted by the <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~icce/" target="_blank">Institute for Civic and Community Engagement</a> at <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu" target="_blank">San Francisco State University</a>. It was mid-December 2009. He was planning a trip to Armenia, where he runs a program at the <a href="http://aua.am/" target="_blank">American University of Armenia</a>. A couple of conversations later, he agreed to work on some aspect of OLPC with his team there. We applied for a couple of OLPC XO 1.5 laptops via the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Contributors" target="_blank">Contributor Program</a> and Barry took two XOs to Yerevan, Armenia. It turned out, the little green machines were a big hit!</p>
<p>Over the next few months I exchanged notes with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rubina-danilova/9/103/ba" target="_blank">Rubina Danilova</a>, who was the Program Coordinator at AUA. We got a rudimentary plan together to translate <a href="http://translate.sugarlabs.org/hy" target="_blank">Sugar into Armenian</a>. We got Rubina signed up as admin with Chris Leonard&#39;s help. By mid 2010, Rubina was translating Sugar strings into Armenian.&nbsp; She also enlisted a few others to help with the translation. In the mean time, we found out about a parallel effort to translate Sugar into Armenian and eventually deploy XOs. Again, after a few email exchanges, more people came on board and finished bulk of the translation.</p>
<p>After that, there was a period of silence, except for a couple of news articles on an effort to distribute XOs in Armenia. Then things took off. A Twitter feed and a Facebook page started for <a href="http://www.nurarmenia.org/" target="_blank">NUR Armenia</a>. A few days ago, I saw an article in OLPC Association&#39;s Summer newsletter on Nagorno-Karabakh and the 3,300 XOs deployed there.</p>

<p>I send this photo to Rubina. I heard back from her last week:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you say &quot;full circle&quot;?</p>
<p>Kudos to Barry, Rubina, all the translators and of course, the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Contributors" target="_blank">Contributor Program</a>. It works!</p>
