title: Doodling on the XO-4 Touch

<p>I was simply doodling on the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO-4" target="_blank">XO-4 Touch</a>. One thing led to another, and before I knew, I was adjusting brush sizes, mixing colors and finger-painting away. Given that the &quot;touch&quot; is based on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/02/neonode-zforce-uses-infrared-leds-to-measure-pressure-replace-c/" target="_blank">infrared LEDs and photodiodes</a>, the resolution and response is impressive - even for a terrible finger-painter like me!</p>
<p>Hint: I think those are really tall Redwood trees :-)</p>
