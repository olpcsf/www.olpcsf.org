	<p>This year&#39;s event is a little different. We are joining forces with some of the other projects in the <a href="http://commons.sfsu.edu" target="_blank">Commons</a> space at <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu" target="_blank">San Francisco State University</a>. This year&#39;s event is called <a href="http://hackathon.sfsu.edu" target="_blank">Open Hack 2018</a>.</p>

		The event is largely scheduled to run on Saturday (April 28) and Sunday (April 29). Will have a meet-and-greet event on Friday evening (April 27), but the main event will begin on Saturday (April 28).</div>

	<div dir="auto">
		The format is as follows:</div>
	<div dir="auto">
		&nbsp;</div>
	<ul dir="ltr">
		<li>
			What we typically refer to as &quot;projects&quot; are called &quot;Challenges&quot; in this format. Anybody can <a href="http://hackathon.sfsu.edu/challenges" target="_blank">Submit a Challenge</a>. When submitting the Challenge, you have to provide us with information about the Challenge itself, existing resources, people involved, and the kinds of skills that you may find helpful in completing this challenge. The goal is that we would want to complete some degree of the Challenge by the time we get to Sunday afternoon.</li>
		<li>
			The Challenges will be printed and posted up on the wall starting Friday (April 27). On Saturday morning (April 28), people who come in will assign themselves to different challenges. It&#39;s quite common for some of the challenges to not have any interested people. That&#39;s okay.</li>
		<li>
			As we start to see a cluster of people collecting on a given Challenge, we will allocate a room for them and then that room becomes their space for the next day and a half. Unlike in the past, where we had timed sessions (typically 75 minutes), these groups get to work on their problem for the entire day Saturday and half day Sunday.</li>
		<li>
			On Sunday afternoon, they present their progress and future direction. The work (code, content, etc) will have to be made available some place (a repo such as github) via a FOSS, or CreativeCommons, or OpenData license.</li>
		<li>
			After the presentations, a panel of judges will determine some form of ranking. There may also be some token prizes.</li>
	</ul>

		This is somewhat different from what we&#39;ve done in the past, but given the level of maturity in our projects, and the amount of focus that is needed to work on fixing bugs and building upon what we already have, the hackathon approach seems to be more apt than simple presentations. If you have somebody in mind who cannot be there physically, you can always bring them in online. The rooms are fairly well equipped, with whiteboards, projectors and Internet access. We are also in the process of arranging for other operational logistics.</div>
