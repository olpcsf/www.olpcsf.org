<p>Hello everybody!<br />
	<br />
	The <a href="http://www.olpcsf.org/CommunitySummit2011" target="_blank">community summit</a> is finally over. I think Tuukka Hastrup was the last of the attendees (he stayed back for &quot;<a href="http://bib.archive.org" target="_blank">Books in Browsers</a>&quot; event) and I saw him off at the BART station on Monday, so its finally over :-) I hope you all have arrived back at your homes safely. Thank you all for coming. This event happens because you attend. This event *<strong>is</strong>* you, and we are all very happy to be able to host it.</p>
<p>Thank you, <a href="http://sfmayor.org" target="_blank">San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee</a> for declaring October 22, 2011 as One Laptop per Child Day in San Francisco!<br />
	<br />
	I&#39;d like to thank the <a href="http://cob.sfsu.edu" target="_blank">College of Business at SF State</a> for being such a gracious host, in particular <a href="http://cob.sfsu.edu/cob/about/dean.cfm" target="_blank">Dean Caran Colvin</a>&#39;s support. I&#39;d also like to thank <a href="http://cob.sfsu.edu/cob/directory/staff_profile.cfm?staffid=10050" target="_blank">Yuliana Diestel</a>, our downtown location coordinator who manages all the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; bookings, shipping/receiving, reserving the loading dock, and a whole bunch of other coordination. Without Yuli this would be very hard to pull off. Of course &quot;Thank you&quot; to <a href="http://cob.sfsu.edu/cob/directory/faculty_profile.cfm?facid=387" target="_blank">Aaron Anderson</a> (Director, Graduate Programs) and the entire SFSU Downtown Center staff for being so supportive.<br />
	<br />
	Then, there is the student volunteer crew who manage registration, t-shirts, stickers, cranks, and all the other stuff, in addition to making coffee, moving things back and forth from storage. Thank you, <a href="http://imsa.sfsu.edu" target="_blank">IMSA</a> volunteers!<br />
