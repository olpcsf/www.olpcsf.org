Thank you all who attended in person or online. During the Summit we presented the proclamation from San Francisco&#39;s Mayor Ed Lee that Saturday October 18th, 2014 is One Laptop Per Child Day!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px;">Our community works hard to bring child-centered education to some of the most remote places in the world. By leveraging technology, we&#39;ve created an ecosystem of self-empowered learning which can reach a very broad audience. From our beloved green XOs, to inexpensive Android tablets, to what hardware lies beyond, students previously without access or with limited access to education and information now have a low power, low cost device with which to collaborate and explore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px;">These accomplishments do not come for free! Through years of research, hours of hard work, successes and failures we&#39;ve accomplished a lot. There is still more to do, but we take a moment to pause and reflect. Let us recognize the hard work that we&#39;ve all done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:18px;">The City and County of San Francisco recognizes this hard work. As presented at the Summit, Mayor Ed Lee has proclaimed Saturday October 18th, 2014 to be One Laptop Per Child Day! The proclamation reads:</span></p>
