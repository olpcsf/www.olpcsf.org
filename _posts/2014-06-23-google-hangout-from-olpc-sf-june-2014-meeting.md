<p>Thanks to Mike Lee, a recording of the Google Hangout from our June 2014 meeting is up on Youtube. Clearly there are better ways of managing Google Hangouts, and clearly I don&#39;t know most of these, so once again, thanks to Mike Lee for saving the day! For the parts of the session on XOVis, you can see a blog post at {{ site.baseurl }}/node/208, and get slides from http://www.slideshare.net/sverma/xovis-analyticsvisualizationsugarolpc-36184541 . Braddock Gaskill&#39;s slides on <a href="http://internet-in-a-box.org/" target="_blank">Internet-in-a-Box</a> are posted on GitHub at https://github.com/braddockcg/internet-in-a-box/raw/master/doc/201402_SCALE_Presentation/IIAB_SCALE_Presentation.odp</p>
