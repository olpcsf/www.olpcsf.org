<p>It&#39;s that time of the year, when we once again gather our ideas, our projects, our hopes and come together at the <a href="http://olpcsf.org/summit">OLPC San Francisco Community Summit 2012</a>.</p>
<h2 class="rtecenter">
	<strong>Oct 19-21, 2012</strong></h2>

<p>As projects mature and insights become distinct, we are starting to fine tune our efforts. A spectrum has emerged. We see deployments that are structured, complete with curricula, teacher training, and support. Much credit goes to the planning and foresight of projects in <a href="http://www.ceibal.org.uy/" target="_blank">Uruguay</a>, <a href="http://www.perueduca.edu.pe/olpc/OLPC_Home.html" target="_blank">Peru</a>, <a href="http://laptop.org/en/children/countries/rwanda.shtml" target="_blank">Rwanda</a>, <a href="http://www.fijisun.com.fj/2012/09/14/one-laptop-per-child-plan-next-month/" target="_blank">Fiji</a>, and many other places. We also see &quot;helicopter&quot; style deployments (note: helicopter is optional) where children have <a href="https://evanszablowski.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/one-laptop-per-child/" target="_blank">close to zero training</a>, and are <a href="https://bhagmalpur.wordpress.com/2011/11/28/so-whats-working/" target="_blank">still able use the computers</a>, support each other and come up with innovative ways of learning. Over time, we witness stories of children in projects such as in Uruguay, where <a href="http://www.fing.edu.uy/inco/proyectos/butia/" target="_blank">they work wonders</a> with robots. We also see how the XO laptop is a valued friend for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnKhVajQ6rw" target="_blank">children like Abel</a> in Peru. In Jamaica, we see <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/laura_nk/6844873639" target="_blank">Jon Marc</a>, a six-year old, who has figured out Python games and modifies these to make his own.</p>
<p>Yes! It&#39;s working.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><a href="http://olpcsf.org/CommunitySummit2012"><img alt="" src="http://www.olpcsf.org/sites/default/files/u8/red_xo_in_sf_fog_2012.jpg" style="height: 260px; width: 680px;" /></a></p>
<p>Once we get XOs into communities, there is a secondary effect. Children learn, but what if these machines could be used as a conduit for digital libraries? Everything from ebooks to Khan Academy videos could be made available on these green machines. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sverma/pathagar-a-book-server" target="_blank">That effort is under way</a>. We need to make it better. Perhaps run solar-powered microclouds in remote environs?<br />
	<br />
	Then there&#39;s new hardware such as the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/XO-1.75" target="_blank">XO 1.75</a>, running on very low power chips and the upcoming <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/15/one-laptop-per-child-details-the-xo-4-touch-a-touchscreen-convertible-notebook-for-emerging-markets/" target="_blank">XO-4</a> promises to be even better. One variant will even have a touchscreen. What will touch bring to learning? How will Sugar address this space? All of this makes for exciting anticipation.<br />
	<br />
	Then there&#39;s Sugarcamp (<strong>Oct 22-24</strong>). This year, Sugarcamp in San Francisco gets an extra ++. It&#39;s more like <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugarcamp_SF_2012" target="_blank">Sugarcamp++</a>. Right after the weekend of discussion at the Summit, <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugarcamp_SF_2012" target="_blank">Sugarcamp++</a> will tackle all that has been done so far and improve upon it from there on.&nbsp; Improvement of Sugar towards a 1.0 release, robots with microcontroller boards, content servers that serve both large and small deployments, and much more! Contributors of all kinds will be there. The venue is the same as the OLPC SF Summit - <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu" target="_blank">San Francisco State University</a>&#39;s Downtown Campus.</p>
<p>And as we get ready to kick off the weekend&#39;s larger <a href="http://olpcsf.org/summit">OLPC San Francisco Community Summit 2012</a>, followed by <a href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugarcamp_SF_2012" target="_blank">Sugarcamp++</a>, we hope that you will join us in asking questions, solving problems and making things better for the citizens of tomorrow - all the things that make for an awesome community.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
