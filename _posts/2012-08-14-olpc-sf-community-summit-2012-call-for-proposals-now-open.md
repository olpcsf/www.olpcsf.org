<p>Call for proposals for OLPC San Francisco Community Summit 2012 is now open. Sessions will be on Saturday, Oct 20 and Sunday, Oct 21 2012.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we are looking for workshop-style sessions, and not just slide presentations. The goal of the sessions is to present information <strong>and</strong> to work on problems. Think of other people who may be interested in working with you. Talk to them and put them on your proposals. Think constructive, not just instructive!</p>
<p>Let the ideas flow!</p>
