<p>We left from Bolinas on XXX and flew to Paris, where we met with the OLPC France team. &lt;Add some stuff here&gt;.</p>
<p>Next, we took a short hop to Morocco. &lt;Add something brief here&gt;</p>
<p>Back to Paris, we flew to Madagascar on XXX</p>
<p>As we wind up our stay in Antananarivo, Madagascar, here&#39;s a summary of what we have been able to pull together.</p>
<h3>
	Library- Cookie Shop</h3>
<p>On Thursday after our meeting at the Embassy with Brett, Jaona and Feantsoa we went to the Cookie Shop where we met Volana and talked about the project. &nbsp;The library in the Cookie Shop is an interim space until the American Center is completed. We decided the space could hold 4 laptops effectively. On Friday we returned to the Cookie Shop to set up the Pathagar Bookserver and the 4 laptops. &nbsp;We ran through the basic operation of the XOs and tested the server. &nbsp;The lemur books from the collection as well as our Internet Archives books came across quite well as did the Khan Academy videos. &nbsp;The bookserver is working as it should as a stand alone server without the ethernet connection. &nbsp;At a time in the future when there is an internet connection we can collect data from the server to analize the laptop use. Monday we checked into the Cookie Shop and found that Volana had the laptops well in hand and everything seemed to be working well.</p>
<h3>
	New School Deployment</h3>
<p>Thursday afternoon we met with Dr. Hanta Rasaminana who has given us permission to include her AKO Project books on Lemurs. &nbsp;She is working towards setting up a classroom to introduce an alternative method of educating children through exploration. &nbsp;We are hoping to supply her with OLPC_XO laptops for her classroom. &nbsp;She is known in the US as the Lemur Lady through her appearance on a CNN special and for her involvement in education in Madagascar where she holds an appointment at the Ecole Normale Superieur.</p>
<h3>
	Complimentary Deployments</h3>
<p>We have arranged for Peace Corps Volunteer, Jesse McKinney to pick up laptops for Ranomafama. &nbsp;He is offering to work on the environmental education application for the XO. &nbsp;I believe there are several summer programs including a camp where he can use the laptops. &nbsp;He will also set up a bookserver to allow access the same collection of books and videos as the Cookie Shop. He has a background in web design and is willing to pull together some of the available Peace Corps teaching material.<br />
	<br />
	Former PCV Maya Moore will pick up laptops to take to Tamatave for the Madagascar Fauna Group project. &nbsp;This group is a collective of Zoological Institutions who work in conservation( <a href="http://savethelemur.org" target="_blank">savethelemur.org</a>). This organization has environmental education material that will dovetail nicely with the XO.</p>
<h3>
	New Deployment- Diego</h3>
<p>Brett took 5 laptops for the opening of new Diego Suarez Interactive Space. &nbsp;I&#39;ve posted the photos he took to FB where they will be on the OLPC-SF page. &nbsp;Thanks Brett.</p>
<h3>
	YCC-</h3>
<p>Tuesday we met Felantsoa at the Youth Center where we picked up 4 of the XO !.5s and the Pathagar Bookserver. &nbsp;The bookserver will be updated and the Lemur Books and Khan Academy videos added. &nbsp;The 4 XOs will go to the Biodiversity Center at the zoo where educational content will be developed to reflect the animals currently at the zoo. When the Bookserver is prepared we will send it back to the YCC.</p>
<p>NB. &nbsp;The bookserver can be used for the laptops in the YCC for the English learning program in addition to the XOs.<br />

<h3>
	Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>By drawing biologists and educators into our projects we hope to tap into sources of information they can access, develop content specific for Madgascar for the bookserver and share this content amongst deployments. &nbsp;I will keep in contact with Jesse and Maya to follow their progress. &nbsp;I believe Jesse has the technical expertise to be able to add new content to the bookserver. &nbsp;The people at the Biodiversity Center are enthusiastic about setting up an interpretive area for children. Isabella is interested in coming back to help with the English learning programs and will follow up when she has a sense of when she can travel back to Madagascar. &nbsp;In the meantime we will collect audible books to add to your library for the English program.</p>
