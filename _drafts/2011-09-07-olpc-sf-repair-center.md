<p>The OLPC SF Repair Center was started by Joachim to provide repair services to local XO users. For the time being, all repairs are performed by Joachim, however, if interest is great enough, OLPC SF Repair has the ability to expand into an official project at the Engineering Design Center at San Francisco State University.</p>
